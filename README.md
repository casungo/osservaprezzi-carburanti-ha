### Cron Expression Configuration

The integration uses a cron expression to schedule automatic data updates. This can be configured after initial installation through the integration options.

**Default value**: `30 8 * * *` (daily at 8:30 AM)

You can modify this expression to customize when you want the data to be updated. You can use [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru) to help build and validate your cron expressions. This tool provides a helpful interface to understand when your scheduled updates will run.

Common examples:

- `0 8 * * *` - Daily at 8:00 AM
- `30 7,19 * * *` - Daily at 7:30 AM and 7:30 PM
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours
- `0 8 * * 1-5` - Weekdays at 8:00 AM

### How to Find the Station ID

During configuration, you will be asked to enter the **Station ID** of the facility you want to monitor. To find the Station ID:

1. Go to https://carburanti.mise.gov.it/ospzSearch/zona
2. Search for your favorite station
